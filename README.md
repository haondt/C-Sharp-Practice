[Project 3](https://github.com/haondt/C-Sharp-Practice/tree/master/LINQ/LINQApp) is a searching/indexing engine that performs various searches over a set of Reddit comments, supplied by a [10000-entry json file](https://github.com/haondt/C-Sharp-Practice/blob/master/LINQ/reddit_comments.json). Each `CommentSearcher` method is meant to implement a different aspect of LINQ searching as demonstrated in [this](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/linq/linq-tutorials) tutorial.
